_"Surreal, silly, insightful..."_ Fringe Guru

_(can you also send me the icons of the Brighton fringe awards)_

A parasitic worm and a white blood cell in the intestines. This absurdist physical comedy piece blends cartoon imagery with colourful, eccentric characters that are magnetic in empathy.

Karl, like all of us, has spent a lot of time looking for his ideal habitat, where he could live in peace. Brian is at his first day of work. A white blood cell and a faithful servant to the body with a generous heart. He works in solitary but is supervised and directed by the all powerful brain, who manifests itself in the appearance of a telephone. In a world threatened by the problem of coexistence and compliance, is it still possible to be “Gut Buddies”?
