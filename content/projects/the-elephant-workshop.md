**The Elephantâ€™s Workshop** is an installation of abstract storytelling. A series of images and sounds collide to create a swamp-like atmosphere, where the themes of fragility, co-existence, and the fear of losing life and love are juxtaposed. A Piano tuner, and his elephant-like shadow appear as extracts, whilst showing withered bodies that desire to create new life, but where the potentially destructive underside of creation can be seen as a shadow for looming global catastrophe.

It was developed and performed at Destelheide Brussels, Belgium and Eden Studios, Berlin Germany.
