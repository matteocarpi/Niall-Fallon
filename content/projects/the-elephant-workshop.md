**The Elephantâ€™s Workshop** installation presents a disjointed world of a piano tuner and his spectre through abstract storytelling. A series of brittle poetic images collide to allude to themes of transformation, trapping, and the lust for preservation.

It was developed and performed live at Destelheide Brussels Belgium and Eden Studios, Berlin Germany in 2019. Later featuring as a short film as part of the Abstand Bitte Festival PAF Berlin 2021.

Created and composed by Niall Fallon.
