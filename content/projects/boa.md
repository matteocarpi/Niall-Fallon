Alongside my own creations, I also work as the co-director of the Berlin Opera Academy Studio program, after having been the movement director and choreographer for BOA in both Berlin 2022 and Switzerland 2021. My work there as a physical theatre practitioner and performance coach focuses on using psychosomatic physical exercises to evoke ensemble creativity.

Under the umbrella of _movement_ work, I help actors and performers who were more used to recital contexts to prepare for more developed theatrical and operatic performances. Combining the world of dance with play, acting, fitness training, Alexander Technique, martial arts, and improvisation.

I also provide bespoke performance coaching, training the craft of the actor, presence, posture, and character development, as a means of tuning their use of space in performance and how constructing one’s imagination can completely shift the way we sing and act into effective performance skills.

Through combining contemporary and traditional dance practises with martial arts, Alexander technique, The Feldenkrais Method and the psychosomatic exercises of Jaques Lecoq.

As the director of the Berlin Opera Academy Studio program, I specialise in developing the technique of an Opera performer’s physical presence and tuning their emotional expression in connection with spatial techniques and philosophies for the art of live performance.
