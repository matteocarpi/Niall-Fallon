    _"Surreal, silly, insightful..."_ Fringe Guru

    _(can you also send me the icons of the Brighton fringe awards)_

    A parasitic worm and a white blood cell in the intestines. This absurdist physical comedy piece blends cartoon imagery with colourful, eccentric characters that are magnetic in empathy.

    Karl, like all of us, has spent a lot of time looking for his ideal habitat, where he could live in peace. Brian is at his first day of work. A white blood cell and a faithful servant to the body with a generous heart. He works in solitary but is supervised and directed by the all powerful brain, who manifests itself in the appearance of a telephone. In a world threatened by the problem of coexistence and compliance, is it still possible to be “Gut Buddies”?

    _The Elephant’s Workshop_ is a work-in-progress installation of abstract storytelling. A series of images and sounds collide to create a swamp-like atmosphere, where the themes of fragility, co-existence, and the fear of losing life and love are juxtaposed. A Piano tuner, and his elephant-like shadow appear as extracts, whilst showing withered bodies that desire to create new life, but where the potentially destructive underside of creation can be seen as a shadow for looming global catastrophe.

    This project is in research and development, recently in residence at Destelheide Brussels, Belgium.

    The Whilst Walking Theatre Festival was a national tour across India, including performances, theatrical experiments, and workshops, all pointing towards to a sense of a _Theatre Lab_ setting. The Showcase was informed and inspired by the performer’s contemporary European contexts, alongside myths and the personal stories of the creators. The seven person collective was for the first time present in front of Indian audiences exploring the universal appeal of creation methods.

    At the heart of the work was an exploration of physical ensemble in performance. By using the body as a physical tool for creation, we explored the idea of a collective unconscious. In connection with our training, we searched for organic, historical and mythical means of communication through the body in theatre.

    By being in a foreign context, the showcase became an intercultural exchange, inviting precise feedback that developed the company’s strategies to question the function of performance worldwide.

    The festival offered Workshops that explored the devising process used by the collective. This was a way for us to share our methods of theatrical creation with young to mid-career artists across India and evolve their shared performance vocabulary. The exchanges with participants along the way subsequently developed the work presented in each respective city.

    Curated and facilitated by Niall Fallon, Julia Vandehof, Titas Dutta, Ainhoa Hevia Uria, Matteo Carpi, Gina Battle Oliva, Vivek Kumar
